        <h3>Access to your personal information</h3>
        <p>In most cases, you may have access to personal information that we hold about you. We will handle requests for access to your personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>
        <p>All requests for access to your personal information must be directed to the Privacy Officer by email using the email address provided above or by writing to us at our postal address.</p>
        <p>We will deal with all requests for access to personal information as quickly as possible. Requests for a large amount of information, or information that is not currently in use, may require further time before a response can be given. We may
            charge you a fee if permitted for access if a cost is incurred by us in order to retrieve your information, but in no case will we charge you a fee for your application for access.</p>
        <p>In some cases, we may refuse to give you access to personal information that we hold about you. This may include circumstances where giving you access would:</p>
        <uL>
            <li>be unlawful (eg, where a record that contains personal information about you is subject to a claim for legal professional privilege by one of our contractual counterparties);</li>
            <li>have an unreasonable impact on another person’s privacy; or</li>
            <li>prejudice an investigation of unlawful activity.</li>
        </uL>
        <p>We may also refuse access where the personal information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings.</p>
        <p>If we refuse to give you access, we will provide you with reasons for our refusal.</p>
        <br>

            steps to do so.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Storage and security of your personal information</h3>
